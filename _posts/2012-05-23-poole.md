During the last two weeks Samen and I pushed hard on **Poole**, formally known as "The Github Editor". Here's the first working version, ready for internal testing. I'll spend some more days after I'm back from NYC to further tighten the UI and get rid of flaws that may occur. However, until then go give it a play. :)


Here comes Poole
=================

**Poole** is a web-interface dedicated for managing dynamic content of Jekyll-based websites. Users of Jekyll can create and edit and remove files that live within the _posts directory. Poole is just a static webpage, without requiring any server-side bits. Instead it interacts directly with the Github API for managing your repo's contents. 

How does it work?

Troubles
-----------------

A lot. The Github API is somewhat funky from time to time, and very hard to debug. A hell of CORS and headers foo. The thing that is challenging here, is that Github just offers a low level API, which is problematic in many cases, as it requires a lot of subsequent requests to do simple things, which slows down site performance




Architecture
=================


Github.js
-----------------

Github.js is a higher-level wrapper around the Github API. It's intended for exactly our use case, namely interacting with Github from the browser. It supports
