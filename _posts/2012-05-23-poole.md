During the last two weeks Samen and I pushed hard on **Poole**, formally known as "The Github Editor". Here's the first working version, ready for internal testing. I'll spend some more days after I'm back from NYC to further tighten the UI and get rid of flaws that may occur. However, until then go give it a play. :)

Here comes Poole
=================

**Poole** is a web-interface dedicated for managing dynamic content of Jekyll-based websites. Users of Jekyll can create, edit and delete files that live within the _posts directory. Poole itself is also just a static webpage, and doesn't require any server-side bits. Instead it interacts directly with the Github API for managing your repo's contents. Once we are ready, Poole will feature a quickstart page, that can maintained in Poole itself. Crazy, isn't it?


How does it work?
=================

Browse Repositories
-----------------

This is the landing page, it gives you all the repositories you have access to. If a Jekyll site has multiple branches, you are prompted to select your desired branch, otherwise, you jump into the repo's directly.

Browsing Posts

Edit Posts
-----------------

We use CodeMirror, a great software that makes browser-based editing a pleasure (the first time). Compare it to a regular textarea (which has an inline scoller).

Preview
-----------------

You can instantly preview your writing by either clicking the preview icon at the document menu bar, or use that fance keyboard combo ctrl+shift+p to toggle Preview on and off.

Troubles
-----------------

A lot. The Github API is somewhat funky from time to time, and very hard to debug. A hell of CORS and headers foo. The thing that is challenging here, is that Github just offers a low level API, which is problematic in many cases, as it requires a lot of subsequent requests to do simple things, which slows down site performance




Architecture
=================


Github.js
-----------------

Github.js is a higher-level wrapper around the Github API. It's intended for exactly our use case, namely interacting with Github from the browser. It supports


Gatekeeper
-----------------

Because of some [security-related limitations](http://blog.vjeux.com/2012/javascript/github-oauth-login-browser-side.html), Github prevents you from implementing the OAuth Web Application Flow on a client-side only application.

This is a real bummer. So I built [Gatekeeper](http://github.com/developmentseed/gatekeeper), which is the missing piece you need in order to make it work.
