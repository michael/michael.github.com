Here comes Poole
=================

During the last two weeks Samen and I pushed hard on Poole, formally known as "The Github Editor". Here's the first working version, ready for internal testing. I'll spend some more days after I'm back from NYC to further tighten the UI and get rid of flaws that may occur.

Troubles
-----------------

A lot. The Github API is somewhat funky from time to time, and very hard to debug. A hell of CORS and headers foo. The thing that is challenging here, is that Github just offers a low level API, which is problematic in many cases, as it requires a lot of subsequent requests to do simple things, which slows down site performance
